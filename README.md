# Hello

I see you found this, it's not pretty huh? This is just a landing page for the code that implements code into the Homebrewery for the City of Mist: Garage (or your personal stuff). If you need help with Homebrewery please go to the [Reddit for Homebrewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/homebrewery/). If you find any ACTUAL bugs please post them in issues. Please support [Homebrewery](https://www.patreon.com/NaturalCrit) and [Son of Oak](cityofmist.co)

If you got here from somewhere else, click [this](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/1B5PW5fKPnJBANk-ZiRbUvsVsu5NXwpDTYkXFx4fA7Wu8) to understand

(No this hasn't been going on since 2018, that's just because I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to start this).
